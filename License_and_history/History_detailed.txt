FastCap2 Detailed History
=========================

Porting Version 3.60, 2015/08/04
- Ported under Visual Studio Community edition 2013 (supports MFC)
- Ported to x64, while keeping also x32 support

Porting Version 3.51, 2011/03/24
- Fixed a bug about total execution time calculation, that did
  not consider the preconditioner set-up time 
- Defined the default samples directory as the shared documents directory
- Cleaned up for Sources distribution

Porting Version 3.5, 2010/07/24
- Updated help to be able to open .pdf guides from the browser  
- Added solve time and memory information, dumped on request
  (new run option '-z'). The timing information can be retrieved
  via automation as well
- Added return status information available via Automation
  (normal end, out of memory, etc.)

Porting Version 3.4, 2010/04/30
- Modified code to work also for unprivileged users:
  KB254957 bug (registry update code) and retrieving the path
  from HKLM, while storing user info in HKCU

Porting Version 3.31, 2007/07/18
- Fixed bug causing hang-up when reading FastCap2-format
  input file not beginning with '0' title line 

Porting Version 3.3, 2005/12/22
- Integrated 'getting started' tutorials in the Help files

Porting Version 3.2, 2005/06/29
- Fixed the bug fix for global permittivity factor. The old bug fix
  simply removed the multiplication by 'relperm' in mksCapDump()
  in file mulDisplay.c, however this prevented the global scaling of
  permittivity in case of list files, as described in the User's
  Manual. Therefore, now the read_all_surfaces() function in file
  input.c has been modified to use a default value for outer 
  permittivity of simple conductors (not specified through a list file)
  of 1.0, so the results are not multiplied by 'relperm' two times
  but are always scaled also in case of list files.

Porting Version 3.1, 2005/01/26
- Support for file names containing spaces when called through 
  Automation (provided names are enclosed in quotas),
  modifying parseCmdLine() in FastCap2.cpp/h

Porting Version 3.0, 2004/12/10
- Fixed bug in quickif.c regarding triangle patches in input files
  when using list files
- Added Automation support by copying from a 'scratch' FastCap class
- Removed the possibility to pass arguments to FastCap when
  launching from the command line (must use Automation)
- Added passing of results from FastCap thread to main thread to 
  return through automation
- Modified all MessageBox() calls to direct writes on the FastCap view
- Added a Wrapper function to access Automation objects as a client,
  for callback functions
- Added a list of messages sent by viewprintf() to implement log
  callback in AUtomation, since Automation calls are not allowed
  during input synchronous calls (::SendMessage())
