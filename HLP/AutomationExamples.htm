<H1>FastCap2 Automation Example Programs</H1>

Altough Automation is a complex topic, using FastCap2 via Automation is simple enough. To get you started, we have created some example scripts which can be used to learn how to control FastCap2 and as a base to build more complex applications. In spite of their short length, these examples are quite comprehensive and the source code is well commented.

<p>You can find the example files in a sub-directory in FastCap2's installation directory.

<H2>FastCapClient Sample Program</H2>
This is the most complete example, which shows the use of all FastCap2 methods and properties. To compile this example, you must have MS Visual Basic 6.0 (or newer) installed.

<H2>fc_drive.xls Sample Program</H2>
This is a Visual Basic for Applications example. To run this example, you must have MS Excel 2000 (or newer) installed. 
<p>Remark: for the script to work, you must answer 'yes' at the prompt which asks you if you want to enable the macros, when you load the file into Excel.
<p>Remark: the files sphere0.qui, sphere1.qui, sphere2.qui, sphere3.qui are used by this script and must reside in the same directory of fc_drive.xls for the script to work.

<H2>fcdriv.vbs Sample Program</H2>
This is a Visual Basic Script example. To run this example, you only need one of the following Windows versions: Me, 2000, XP. The best way to launch this script is from a DOS shell, typing "cscript fcdriv.vbs", in the directory where fcdriv.vbs resides.
You can also double-click on the file name, but in this case all the log messages will appear in separate pop-up message boxes.
<p>Remark: the files sphere0.qui, sphere1.qui, sphere2.qui, sphere3.qui are used by this script and must reside in the same directory of fcdriv.vbs for the script to work.
