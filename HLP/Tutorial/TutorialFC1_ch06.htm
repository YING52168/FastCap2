<H1>Refine the geometry to achieve greater accuracy</H1>


<H2>The capacitance of a sphere</H2>

  <p>The sphere is a geometrical object for which a closed-form formula for the calculation of capacitance exists. By Gauss's law, a conducting sphere with one meter radius in free space has a capacitance of 4&pi;&epsilon;<SUB>0</SUB> Farad, that is, about 0.111265 nF.
  <p>By comparing this result with FastCap2's, which is 0.1058 nF, we have about 5% error in the capacitance value. FastCap2's declared accuracy is 1%, but only provided with a suitable input discretization. 

<H2>A refined sphere</H2>

<ol>
  <li>Load in FastModel the input file named <i>sphere2.qui</i>, which is located in the same directory of <i>sphere1.qui</i>. 
  <li>Examine the sphere in the FastModel panel. You'll see that this is a more refined model of a sphere. 
  <li>Launch FastCap2 on the new input file, just like you did with the previous file. 
</ol>

<H2>Checking the result</H2>

<ol>
  <li>Look at the result at the end of FastCap2's output window. The calculated capacitance is 0.1098 nF, which is within 1% of the correct value of 0.111265 nF.
  <li>In this particular case, the correct value of the capacitance was known beforehand trough an analytical formula. But how, in general, the user can be sure to have reached 1% accuracy in the results? To answer this question, load the file <i>sphere3.qui</i>, which is located in the same directory of <i>sphere1.qui</i> and <i>sphere2.qui</i>, into FastModel. 
  <li>Examine the sphere in the FastModel panel. You'll see that this is an even more refined model of a sphere. 
  <li>Launch FastCap2 on the new input file, just like you did with the previous files.  
  <li>Check the new result, which is 0.1109 nF, even closer to 0.111265 nF. However, what is important here is that the capacitance calculated with the file <i>sphere3.qui</i> is within 1% of the capacitance calculated with the file <i>sphere2.qui</i>. This means that we have reached convergence, even if we had not known that the correct result was 0.111265 nF.
