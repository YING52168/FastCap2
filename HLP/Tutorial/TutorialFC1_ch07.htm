<H1>Change the global permittivity factor</H1>

  <p>We have calculated the capacitance of a sphere in free air. Now we would like to see how this capacitance would change if the sphere was embedded in a different dielectric medium, whose relative dielectric constant is different from one.
  
<ol>
  <li>With the file named <i>sphere3.qui</i> open in FastModel, launch FastCap2 but stop at the <b>Run Menu</b> dialog. 
  <li>Change the global permittivity factor to 2, as indicated in the following figure. 
  <li>Launch the simulation by clicking on the <b>Run</b> button. 
  <li>Examine the result. The calculated capacitance is 0.2218 nF, exactly twice the 0.1109 nF value we obtained in the free air, as expected. 
</ol>
